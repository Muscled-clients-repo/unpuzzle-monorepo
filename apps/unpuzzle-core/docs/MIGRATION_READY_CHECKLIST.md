## 🔧 How to Migrate

### Step 1: Test Current System
```bash
# Verify current auth is working
curl http://localhost:3001/api/auth/check

# Should return: {"success":true,"body":{"authenticated":false}}
```

### Step 2: Set Up Supabase (When Ready)
```env
# Add to .env file
AUTH_PROVIDER=supabase
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your-supabase-jwt-secret
```

### Step 3: Run Migration
```bash
# Export current users (creates backup)
npm run migrate-auth:export

# Run full migration  
npm run migrate-auth:migrate

# Verify migration success
npm run migrate-auth:verify
```

### Step 4: Switch Provider
```bash
# Change in .env file
AUTH_PROVIDER=supabase

# Restart server
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Rollback if Needed
```bash
# Instant rollback to Clerk
npm run migrate-auth:rollback

# Change back in .env
AUTH_PROVIDER=clerk
```
