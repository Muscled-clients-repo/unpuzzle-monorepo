# Test Plan: Course Enrollment Status Update

## Test Scenario
Test that the course details page properly updates to show the "Continue Learning" button after a successful purchase without requiring a hard refresh.

## Steps to Test

1. **Navigate to a course details page for a non-enrolled course**
   - Verify the "Buy Now" or "Enroll Now" button is displayed

2. **Click the checkout button**
   - Should navigate to checkout page
   - Session storage flag `recent_purchase_${courseId}` should be set

3. **Complete the purchase**
   - After successful payment, should redirect back to course details page with `?refresh={timestamp}` parameter

4. **Verify immediate update**
   - The course details page should:
     - Remove the refresh parameter from URL
     - Force refetch the course data
     - Show "Continue Learning" button instead of "Buy Now"
     - No hard refresh should be required

5. **Additional polling mechanism**
   - If enrollment status hasn't updated immediately, the EnhancedEnrollmentFeature will:
     - Poll the API every 3 seconds for up to 30 seconds
     - Update the button as soon as enrollment is confirmed

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made:

1. **Checkout redirect with refresh parameter**
   - `/checkout/[id]/checkout-client.tsx`: Added `?refresh=${Date.now()}` to redirect URLs

2. **Course details page refresh handling**
   - `/courses/[id]/course-detail-client.tsx`: Added useEffect to detect refresh parameter and force refetch

3. **Pollable enrollment button**
   - `/components/PollableEnrollmentButton.tsx`: Created wrapper component that polls for enrollment status after purchase
   - Shows "Enrolled - Full Access" message when enrollment is confirmed

4. **Session storage flag**
   - Set when navigating to checkout
   - Triggers polling mechanism when returning to course details

## Expected Behavior
- User should see the "Continue Learning" button within seconds of completing purchase
- No manual page refresh required
- Seamless transition from non-enrolled to enrolled state
