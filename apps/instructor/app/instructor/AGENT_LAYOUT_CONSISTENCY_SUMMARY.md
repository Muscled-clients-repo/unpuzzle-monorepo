# Agent Layout Consistency Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented consistent layout across all four Puzzle Agent screens (PuzzleCheck, PuzzleHint, PuzzlePath, PuzzleReflect) as requested.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Shared Layout Components Created**
- **AgentPageLayout** (`app/components/screens/AgentLayouts/AgentPageLayout.tsx`)
  - Provides consistent left-side video player layout
  - Maintains 65/35 split on desktop, full width on mobile
  - Video player area looks identical across all agent pages
  
- **AgentDetailCard** (`app/components/screens/AgentLayouts/AgentDetailCard.tsx`)
  - Consistent right-side card structure
  - Unified header with gradient backgrounds (unique per agent)
  - Standard metadata grid showing timestamp, created date, student name, and ID
  - Consistent spacing and styling for content areas

### 2. **Color Scheme per Agent Type**
Each agent has a unique gradient color while maintaining consistent structure:
- **PuzzleCheck**: Blue to Cyan (`from-blue-500 to-cyan-600`)
- **PuzzleHint**: Green to Emerald (`from-green-500 to-emerald-600`)
- **PuzzleReflect**: Purple to Pink (`from-purple-500 to-pink-600`)
- **PuzzlePath**: Orange to Amber (`from-orange-500 to-amber-600`)

### 3. **Fixes Implemented**
- Fixed user display showing "undefined" by updating UserInfo interface to match API response
- Updated all pages to use Next.js 15's async params pattern
- Removed external dependencies that were causing build errors
- Ensured proper TypeScript types throughout

### 4. **Consistent Features Across All Pages**
- ✅ Identical left-side video player layout
- ✅ Consistent loading states with centered spinner
- ✅ Unified error handling with styled alert boxes
- ✅ Same authentication flow and redirects
- ✅ Instructor feedback section at bottom of each agent card
- ✅ Dark mode support throughout
- ✅ Responsive design patterns

### 5. **API Integration**
- All pages use Redux RTK Query for data fetching
- Automatic authentication token injection
- Consistent error and loading states
- Added missing `getPuzzlePathById` endpoint

## Result
The application now provides a unified, professional user experience across all agent screens. The left side (video player) remains consistent while the right side maintains the same structure but with agent-specific content and color themes.

## Usage Pattern
```tsx
<AgentPageLayout video={transformedVideo} agentType="check|hint|reflect|path">
  <AgentDetailCard
    title="Agent Title"
    subtitle="Agent Description"
    icon={<AgentIcon />}
    headerGradient="from-color-500 to-color-600"
    // ... other props
  >
    {/* Agent-specific content */}
  </AgentDetailCard>
</AgentPageLayout>
```

This modular approach makes it easy to maintain consistency while allowing flexibility for agent-specific features.
